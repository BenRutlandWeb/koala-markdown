I modified [koala-pug](https://github.com/jkher/koala-pug) to work with markdown for my personal use but maybe you'll find a use too. All credit goes to following authors for all their hardwork:

1. Oklai for [koala-app](http://koala-app.com)
2. Jkher for [koala-pug](https://github.com/jkher/koala-pug)
3. gaberankin for [koala jade compiler](https://github.com/gaberankin/koala-jade)
